Tools and methods allowing to verify that Java builds are reproducible
====================================================

As part of [Reproducible Builds efforts for the JVM](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/jvm/), this "**Reproducible Central**" project attempts to:
1. **[Write `.buildspec`rebuild instructions](BUILDSPEC.md)** for the artifacts available in the [Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/),
equivalent to the packaging instructions that are maintained by every Linux distribution
(for example Debian's [debian/rules](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source#s-debianrules) or ArchLinux's PKGBUILD), whatever the build tool used (Central Repository is not used by Maven only)
2.  **Evaluate the level of reproducibility** obtained using previous instructions. How many output files from the rebuild are strictly equal to the reference in Central Repository? How many output files are not yet reproducible and should be improved before the next release?

## Reproducible journey

If you want to start playing with the reproducible builds, we recommend the following steps.

### 1) Rebuild Yourself To Check Results

Prerequisites:
    
    * [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
    
    * `dos2unix` - DOS to MAC/UNIX text file format converter. 
      
      Can be installed via [homebrew](https://brew.sh) on MAC via: `brew install dos2unix`.

You can rebuild a project release by running:
```
./rebuild.sh content/<path/to/...>/<project>-<version>.buildspec
```
[`rebuild.sh` script](./rebuild.sh) will use the build specification file (= [`.buildspec` file](BUILDSPEC.md)) to choose a Docker image to rebuild the project and check output against Central Repository reference binaries.

For example:
```
./rebuild.sh content/org/apache/maven/shared/archiver/maven-archiver-3.5.1.buildspec
```

### 2) Contribute to a new _buildspec_

If you know of a project released to Central Repository that has enabled Reproducible Builds (see [Configuring Build Tools for Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/jvm/#configuring-build-tools-for-reproducible-builds)), please tell us by opening an issue with details.

You can also choose one from our [list of projects waiting for a `.buildspec`](https://github.com/jvm-repo-rebuild/reproducible-central/labels/buildspec): follow our [instructions to write a new `.buildspec`)](BUILDSPEC.md#writing-a-new-buildspec) that you can contribute back with a PR.


### 3) Improve Reproducibility Score Of A Project Release

If a rebuild published here is not fully reproducible (it still has some :warning: after having applied [Configuring Build Tools for Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/jvm/#configuring-build-tools-for-reproducible-builds)), there is an issue: please help to improve the situation.

You'll need to rebuild the release yourself (see previous instructions), then use [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) :mag: to easily explore the precise difference
between the reference file from Central Repository and the effective rebuild file, then debug up to the root cause of this unwanted difference:
- rebuilder bug: if the improvement has to happen at [buildspec](BUILDSPEC.md) or [rebuild script](rebuild.sh) level, don't hesitate to open an issue or a PR here,
- upstream project reproducibility issue :memo:: please contact the upstream project and help them improve the reproducibility for their next release, creating an issue in their issue tracker and adding it to Reproducible Central buildspec as `issue` parameter that will link to it with a :memo:.



### 4) Add Reproducible Builds Badge to a Project With Reproducible Releases

If a project has listed here at least one release with proven reproducibility success, it can add a badge like ![Reproducible Builds](https://img.shields.io/badge/Reproducible_Builds-ok-success?labelColor=1e5b96) pointing to its entries here:

```
[![Reproducible Builds](https://img.shields.io/badge/Reproducible_Builds-ok-success?labelColor=1e5b96)](https://github.com/jvm-repo-rebuild/reproducible-central#...groupId...:...artifactId...)
```
