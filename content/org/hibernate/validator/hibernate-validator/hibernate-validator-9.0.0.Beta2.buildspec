# Build requires access to the Jakarta EE staging repository.
# This repository has the latest builds of Jakarta Validation TCK that may not necessarily be published to Central yet
# but Hibernate Validator would usually run tests against this staged version of the TCK
# to make sure everything is fine with the TCK.
#
# The `reproducibility-check` has all the required properties set to skip tests,
# gpg signing and other things like code formatting checks etc.
#
# Rebuild command:
command="mvn clean verify -Preproducibility-check -Pjakarta-ee-staging"

# Location of the buildinfo file generated during rebuild (by artifact:compare for Maven) to record output fingerprints
