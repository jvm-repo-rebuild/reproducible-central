display=${groupId}:hibernate-search

# Source code
gitRepo=https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search.git

# Rebuild command
#
# NOTE: automatic skip detection is disabled for this command.
# this is done so as Hibernate Search build explicitly disables
# the maven-deploy-plugin by adding <skip> to its configuration.
#
# And while the nexus plugin is used for deployment and picks which modules to deploy,
# maven-artifact-plugin will see the skip from the deploy plugin and ignore all modules.
#
# Hence, the explicit list of modules to skip:
command="mvn clean package -Pskip-checks -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip -Dgpg.skip -Dno-build-cache -Dbuildinfo.detect.skip=false -Dbuildinfo.skipModules='**/**internal**,**/**integrationtest**,**/**parent**,**/**documentation**,**/**reports**,**/**build**'"

# Location of the buildinfo file generated during rebuild (by artifact:compare for Maven) to record output fingerprints:
buildinfo=target/hibernate-search-parent-${version}.buildinfo

# Link to the Hibernate Search issue tracker if any issues had to be reported:
# issue=https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH
